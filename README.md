## Idea (Brief)
The main idea is to decrease the traffic in public shopping places like malls by implementing a convenient billing technology .
While customer enter a Mart with a trolley which has an inbuilt barcode scanner attached with it, the customer would have to scan the product's barcode before adding it to the trolley, and at the exit gate the trolley will show the sum of prices of all items through a small display attached to near the barcode reader inside the trolley, customer has to just pay that amount via UPI or internet banking and take the item with him/her .
For payment there will be an UPI QR code and Bank AC details pasted on trolley itself .

The positivity behind this idea is, people will now not need to wait in queues for billing their products and will get save their time, and also there will be no mass gathering infront of the billing desk.
The uniqueness behind the idea is that it will break the convectional rule of payment procedures of the mall.
